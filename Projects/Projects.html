        <p class="text-center">At Arbalest Rocketry, our projects are the heartbeat of our aspiration to push the boundaries of space and technology. From the pioneering efforts of Goose-1 to the boundary-pushing Goose-4, each project serves as a milestone in our quest to innovate and explore the cosmos. We aim to achieve unprecedented heights, reaching towards the Kármán line and beyond, while nurturing a culture of collaboration and educational outreach. Moving forward, our vision is to continue expanding the frontier of aerospace engineering, propelled by the unyielding support of our community and the ambition to leave a lasting footprint in the realm of space exploration.</p>

				<h3>Goose 1</h3>
				<p>Our foray into the cosmos began with the innovative hybrid rocket Goose-1, a beacon of our collective ambition and technical prowess. Despite facing the unforeseen hurdles of a global pandemic, we rallied our spirits, leveraging the capabilities of the Lassonde machine shop for precision engineering. Though the pandemic caused delays, our dedication never wavered, setting a precedent of resilience and excellence.</p>

					<h3>Goose 2</h3>
					<p>The Goose 2 rocket soared to new heights, clinching 3rd place at the inaugural Launch Canada competition. Conceived amidst the challenges of limited access to facilities during the pandemic, the team's resourcefulness shone through as we repurposed a basement into our manufacturing hub. Achieving a velocity of Mach 1.37 and an altitude of approximately 5500 meters, Goose 2's successful recovery heralded a new chapter for our team, showcasing our capacity for innovation and adaptation.</p>

					<h3>Goose 3</h3>
					<p>Our ambition took flight with Goose-3, our most ambitious project to date, in collaboration with Maritime Launch Services. Designed for the grand opening of Spaceport Nova Scotia, Goose-3 embraced the challenge of a water landing and achieved a monumental feat—reaching speeds of MACH 2.4 and altitudes around 13500 meters. This milestone not only showcased our team's ingenuity but also our capability to engineer rockets that could reach twice the height of our previous models.</p>

					<h3>Goose 4</h3>
					<p>Goose 4 represents the zenith of Arbalest Rocketry’s endeavors, a bold undertaking aimed at transcending the atmosphere to breach the Kármán line, the gateway to space located 100 kilometers above Earth. This rocket is a marvel of innovation and engineering, encompassing the dreams and determination of every team member. Its design is a testament to our forward-thinking ethos, showcasing a sophisticated three-stage architecture with modular subassemblies that enable versatility and adaptability in design and function.

					The vision behind Goose 4 is not merely to ascend skywards; it is to carve a path for groundbreaking research and educational opportunity. We are meticulously constructing each stage with an eye for detail and efficiency, preparing for the stringent evaluation our rocket will undergo at the 2024 Launch Canada competition. This crucial testing phase is set to validate our design principles and operational capabilities, ensuring readiness for the ambitious goal of spaceflight.

					Our approach is collaborative and iterative, drawing on the collective expertise of a diverse team and the invaluable input from our academic and industry partners. With Goose 4, we are also extending an invitation to student scientists, offering payload space for experiments that can only be conducted in the unique environment that near-space provides. This not only propels Arbalest Rocketry to new altitudes but also contributes to the scientific community, offering tangible data and experiences that could shape future space endeavors.

					As we build Goose 4, we are not just assembling a rocket; we are laying down the tracks for a journey that goes beyond the launchpad. We are committed to ensuring that every aspect of our mission reflects precision, safety, and the pioneering spirit that has become our hallmark. With our sights set high, Goose 4 is more than a project; it is a beacon of our collective aspirations, a symbol of human ingenuity, and a platform for pushing the envelope of what is possible in amateur rocketry and beyond.</p>
